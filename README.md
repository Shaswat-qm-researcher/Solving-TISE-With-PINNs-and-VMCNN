# Solving-TISE-With-PINNs-and-VMCNN
This code allows the user to solve Schrodinger equation with help of deep learning for classical potentials. It is an efficient and faster way for solving the Schrodinger equation, which can extended to understand multidimensional potentials, or many body physics.
